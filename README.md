## Example: Hello World CARTO + deck.gl

A simple point-based layer on top of a CARTO basemap, to get things started. All examples, including our Hello World, are using live data coming from a data warehouse (Google BigQuery, Snowflake, Amazon Redshift...)

Uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to bundle and serve files.
